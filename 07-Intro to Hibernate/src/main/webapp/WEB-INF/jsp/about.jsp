            <h2>Who are we?</h2>        
        	<p>We are big fans of the 1999 the Mummy movie and we decided to help others share the same passion we have through this movie library app.</p>
        	<h2>What is this all about?</h2>
        	<p>In here, you can create a database of your favourite movies to keep track of them. You can also add movies you've yet to watch, create your own categories for them and so on!</p>
