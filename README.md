# assignements_poei_m2i
Repository of a selection of assignements for the 2024 M2i classes I followed. In chronological order:

- algorithms
- html_css
- javascript
- intro to java
- introduction to Databases with SQL
- intro to JEE
- intro to Hibernate
- intro to Angular
- Java Spring and Webservices (see Project)
- Angular (see Project)
- Flutter (TODO: add the flutter exercises)

On top of that we did a project that covered everything we did during the classes. We had to create digital tools for a fictional chain of restaurants. It's split into 3 parts:

- A Java SE application for the administrator. A simple console app in which they can manage their restaurants and their menus
- A JEE application for the clients of the restaurants. It's a public website on which one can look up the different restaurants, their menus and book a table. The frontend part has been coded with HTML / CSS / JS and Bootstrap
- A Spring / Angular application for the employes. The backend provides webservices the teams can use to deal with bookings and orders. The frontend is made with Angular and Bootstrap.

All three of these applications shared a SQL Server database. The scripts folder contains the scripts we used to create and populate it.

You'll find in the project folder a document detailing the making of the project (in French), as well as the slides I used for the oral exam at the end of the classes.
